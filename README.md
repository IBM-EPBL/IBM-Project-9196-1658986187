# University Admit Eligibility Predictor
# IBM-Project-9196-1658986187

# Abstract:
The main objective of this project is to predict the admission process of university based on numerous factors. 
The admission process depends on criteria within the particular college or degree program.
The proposed System helps a person to decide what colleges they can apply to with their scores. 
Machine learning algorithm are used for predictions to get accurate results.
The dataset contains information of the student profile and the university details with a field providing if the admission was correct or not. 
The algorithms we are going to use are Multi Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression and Random Forest.
The project will help the student to know whether they will get admitted in this college or not. We aim to create a portal which filters and provides a list of universities that fall into the student's acceptance range.

# Project Objectives:
Educational institutions Wave always played an important role in society for development and growth of any individual. 
There are many college prediction apps and websites are being maintained, but using them is endless to some extent, due to the lack of accurate information from colleges.
The problem statement is to design a college prediction system and to provide a probabilistic insight into college administration for overall rating, cut-offs of the colleges, admission intake and preferences of students. 
It helps students avoid spending time and money on counselor and stressful research related to finding a suitable college.
We aim to provide a place which would give a perfect output as to how likely it is to enter into a university given upon their own details.
